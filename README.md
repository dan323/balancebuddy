# Web App Features Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the feature roadmap for the web application. The features are divided into **MUST HAVE** features (essential for a functional MVP) and **NICE TO HAVE** features (enhancements to improve user experience and stand out from competitors).

---

## MUST HAVE Features

### 1. **User Management**
- User registration and login (with email and password).
- Profile management (name, profile picture, email updates).
- Session management (e.g., logout, remember me).

### 2. **Group Management**
- Create groups: Users can create groups by providing a name and adding members.
- View groups: A list of all groups a user belongs to.
- Group details: Display group members, expenses, and balances.

### 3. **Expense Tracking**
- Add expenses: Users can add expenses to a group with details like description, amount, and payer.
- Split calculation: Automatically calculate balances for group members.
- Expense list: Display a list of expenses within each group.

### 4. **Static Data Handling**
- Fetch group and expense data from a static JSON file hosted on Netlify.
- Display updates every 6 hours by refetching the JSON file.

### 5. **Basic UI/UX**
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop.
- Intuitive navigation (e.g., sidebars, headers, footers).
